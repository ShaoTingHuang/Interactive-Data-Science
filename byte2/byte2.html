		<h2 align="center"> Is the data complete?</h2>
		<h3 align="center"> Row Data Table </h3>
		<p>
			This is the raw data which I combined two fusion tables together. So how to analyze the data? </br>
			First, it is not a complete data because there are missing data in some countries, such as Benin and Equatorial Guinea, and so on. </br>

		<h3 align="center"> Row Data figure </h3>
		</p> Also, there are only half of data in some countries. How can I address these data? </br>
			I drawed the data first. As the figure below, there are four to five mainly proudcing countries. The other countries produce very few amount of coffee. </br>
			So I check the missing data in the table and I found that all of them are not the main production countries.</br>
			Therefore, I dropped them all. Basically, it is still completed because there is no missing data of main producing countries.</br>

		<h2 align="center"> Is the data coherent? </h2>
		<h3 align="center"> Raw data distribution</h3>
		<p>
		There are two parts to check the coherence - growing area and main countries which produce large amount of coffee beans. </br>
		Coffee bean is growing in the tropical area. So I used the map to check the coffee production distribution. As the graph below, the data is coherent all of the countries are distributed in the tropical and subtropical area. </br>

		<h3 align="center"> The main producing countries </h3>
		<p>
		As the list of countries by coffee production in "International Coffee Association". The top five list countries are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia,and Ethiopia. </br>
		So I sorted the data and drawed the main countries to see if it is coherent. The figure is below. After comparing the result, it is completely coherent.

		<h2 align="center"> Is the data correct? </h2>
		<p> As above, the main producing countries are the same as the research from "International Coffee Association".</br>
			  Let's see the producing percent of them. The figure is below. </br>
				As the figure, the main producing countries produce almost 70% amount of coffee in the world.

		<h2 align="center"> Is the data accountable? </h2>
		<p> The data is from the google fusion table, which is a public resource, everyone can have access to it.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2 align="center"> Interesting results </h2>
		<p> I plot the total amount of production every year and found that it increases almost 50% in the past 15 years. </br>
			  It also increases and decreases in turn every year, which is highly related to the Brazil production.
		</br>
		</br>
		<h3 align="center"><IMG SRC="total_amount.png"></h3>
		</br>
		</br>
		<p> There is also another interesing plot that I created - boxplot. I found that the range of Brazil and Indonesia of production are large.</br>
				The reason might be influenced by the growing environments.
